# LYD Music App

LYD (renamed from Bloc Jams) is a simple music application, featuring two albums with corresponding tracks.
It was the first React project in Bloc's curriculum and gave me a great introduction to working
with a Javascript framework.

## Motivation <a id="motivation"></a>

I was excited to complete this project so I could better understand React, as well as learn best practices for modular programming. Since this was the first time I'd worked with the framework, it was a great opportunity to learn the basics before moving on to more difficult challenges. After completing the basic setup for the project, I wanted to add additional features to further my understanding and create a UI that would be different from other students.
